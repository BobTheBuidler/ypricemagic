    This test iterates over a series of blocks for each stablecoin token provided in

    This strict equality is enforced for the current implementation of stable tokens.
    In a future revision when non‚Äêstable stables are implemented, tolerances for
    rounding and scaling issues may be introduced.

        :func:`tests.fixtures.blocks_for_contract`: for generating block numbers for testing.
