class ChecksumASyncSingletonMeta(ASyncMeta, Generic[T]):
    """
    A metaclass for creating singleton instances with checksummed addresses and asynchronous capabilities.

    This metaclass extends :class:`~a_sync.a_sync._meta.ASyncMeta` to ensure that only one instance of a class
    is created for each synchronous or asynchronous context, with the added functionality of checksumming
    Ethereum addresses using :class:`~checksum_dict.ChecksumAddressDict`.

    The differentiation between synchronous and asynchronous contexts is achieved by using the
    `__a_sync_instance_will_be_sync__` method to determine the context during instance creation.
    Instances are stored in `cls.__instances`, which is a `DefaultDict` of `ChecksumAddressDict` keyed by the context
    (synchronous or asynchronous). This ensures that separate instances are created for each context.

    Examples:
        >>> class MySingleton(metaclass=ChecksumASyncSingletonMeta):
        ...     def __init__(self, address, asynchronous=False):
        ...         self.address = address
        ...         self.asynchronous = asynchronous
        ...
        >>> instance1 = MySingleton('0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb', asynchronous=True)
        >>> instance2 = MySingleton('0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb', asynchronous=True)
        >>> assert instance1 is instance2
